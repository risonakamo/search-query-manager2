query table controls

- sort
- shuffle button
- show only unviewed checkbox
- way to set day amounts of each query
    - this essentially makes a whole new table - each unique query is tied to a date range, so changing the date range means the queries aren't as comparable, unless do something smart such as if a query is fully overlapped
- start date
- amount of days to show in table from start date
- jump to last viewed day button
